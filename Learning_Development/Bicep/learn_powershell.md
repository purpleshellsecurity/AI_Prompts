# Powershell Learning Prompt

Using the Pareto principle, identify the 20% of Azure Powershell concepts that provide 80% of the knowledge needed to deploy production-ready infrastructure. 

Focus on: 
* Core patterns to master first, in logical learning order 
* Most common beginner mistakes and how to avoid them 
* Include practical code examples for each concept
* Ensure that it includes the necessary concepts to teach someone use Powershell and how to write scripts with Powershell best practices.
* Use examples that are compatible with Powershell Version 7 only

Output Format: 
* Progressive learning structure where each topic builds on the previous 
* Each section should include: concept explanation + code example + common pitfall Search 

Guidelines: 
* Only use official Microsoft documentation (docs.microsoft.com) 
* Never use third-party sources, forums, or blogs 
* If Microsoft docs lack information, state what's missing explicitly
