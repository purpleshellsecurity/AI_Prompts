# AI Prompt Library

A curated collection of high-impact prompts for learning, development, and productivity for security professionals.

## 🎯 The Problem
Most AI interactions give you everything about a topic when you only need the essentials. This leads to:

Information overload
Unclear learning priorities
Wasted time on advanced features you don't need yet
Generic advice that doesn't accelerate real-world skills

## 💡 The Solution
By creating repository of targeted AI prompts, you get:

* Laser-focused priorities - What to learn first
* Strategic guidance - What to skip initially
* Practical examples - Real-world applicable code
* Clear progression - Logical learning sequence

## 📚 Prompt Categories

### 🎓 Learning & Development
Strategic prompts designed to accelerate skill acquisition and knowledge building for technical professionals.

Why Learning & Development Prompts Matter:
Instead of getting overwhelming information dumps, these prompts help you identify what to learn first, what to skip initially, and how to build skills progressively. Perfect for busy developers who need to get productive quickly.

🎯 Featured: Pareto Learning Framework

The 80/20 approach to technical learning
Transform generic "explain everything" responses into strategic, prioritized learning paths using the Pareto Principle.

Example Transformation:

❌ Generic approach: "Explain Azure Bicep best practices"
Result: 50+ concepts with no clear priority

✅ Pareto approach: "Using the Pareto principle, identify the 20% of Azure Bicep concepts that provide 80% of the knowledge needed to deploy production-ready infrastructure."
Result: Core concepts in logical learning order with clear next steps.

## 📋 Available Learning Prompts

🏗️ Azure Bicep - Production Ready Infrastructure
File: bicep/bicep-pareto-prompt.md
The flagship prompt that demonstrates the power of strategic learning
What you get:

Essential 20% of concepts for 80% of real-world usage
Progressive learning structure (each topic builds on the last)
Practical code examples for immediate application
Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
Debugging strategies for production issues

Best for: New users to Bicep who need to deploy infrastructure quickly without getting lost in Microsoft Documentation.

Sample output preview:

"Based on the Pareto principle, these core concepts will give you the foundation to deploy production-ready Azure infrastructure with Bicep.
Progressive Learning Path

1. Foundation: File Structure & Basic Syntax
Core Concept: Bicep is a declarative language, which means the elements can appear in any order. Unlike imperative languages, the order of elements doesn't affect how deployment is processed."
